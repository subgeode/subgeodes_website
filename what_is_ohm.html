    <h1>Rhymewave - What is OHM?></h1>
    <p>So what is OHM? Well, it′s kinda hard to tell</p>
    <p>It kind of all depends if it's a symbol or it′s spelled</p>
    <p>Some say it represents the supreme act of creation</p>
    <p>Others will chant it together as a tool for meditation</p>
    <p>Ohm is also measuring electrical resistance</p>
    <p>Which is basically a circuit or components opposition</p>
    <p>To the flow of the electric current working through the system</p>
    <p>And this system can be anywhere electric currents live in</p>
    <p>So OHM is like a Greek Letter that makes me want to eat better</p>
    <p>OHM is like a sacred sound that makes me wanna play around</p>
    <p>OHM is like the flow that I've been feeling in the zone</p>
    <p>And I'm not being overblown cuz you might wanna make it home</p>
    <p>OHM is in the land of the Sasquatch. Underground Camelot</p>
    <p>Paranormal hot spot, so look up at the stars a lot</p>
    <p>OHMs immortal consciousness, a harmonizing mantra</p>
    <p>Resonating chakras all throughout the Ragas</p>
    <p>OHM is now a festival, and basically a communion</p>
    <p>Grassroots from the start. Organic growth and improvements</p>
    <p>OHM can be a vesicle and OHM can be a fluid</p>
    <p>OHM can be a metaphor and this is how we use it</p>
    <p>But puns are fun too</p>
